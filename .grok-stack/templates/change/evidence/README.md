# Evidence

Store human-readable review reports here. Machine receipts live under `.grok-stack/runtime/receipts/` and are bound to the current repository fingerprint.

`state.json` holds canonical local checkpoints and explicit evidence accounting. A `not_run` reason explains unfinished work; a recorded result is self-reported and does not satisfy a passing receipt. Checkpoints are observations in this worktree, and become available to another clone only when separately committed and published.

New-package and first-implementation observations are appended below by the lifecycle commands. A pending README mirror is surfaced in status and can be retried with the same explicit lifecycle command; state and README publication is not a two-file atomic transaction.
