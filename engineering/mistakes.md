# Mistakes

Root causes, not symptoms. Record only mistakes that caused a real problem.

## 2026-08-16 — Self-learning bullets never wired into AGENTS.md

**Symptom:** Agents had `engineering/decisions.md` and `engineering/mistakes.md` but no standing `AGENTS.md` order to write them.
**Root cause:** Authorship omission when `AGENTS.md` was first written as the Engineering Contract (`ca63b2d`); the log files were added later (`097f5c9`) without wiring the trigger. Not a later delete.

## 2026-08-14 — Treated a matcher bug as an environment block

**Symptom:** PreToolUse denied ordinary `ls`/`cat`/`git` and leftover routes had no write owner, so hooks were moved to `.grok/hooks.disabled/`.
**Root cause:** The deny reason was read as “hooks are too strict to work under,” not as “`PRODUCTION_COMMANDS` matches path text and rematch is keyed off `is_development_prompt`.” Disabling the execution machinery hid both bugs and left the stack unable to classify or police itself until the canonical `.grok/hooks/` tree was restored after the fix.

## 2026-08-14 — Bound verification to an intermediate tree

**Symptom:** First `grok_verify --mode pr` could not be the completion receipt; reports and `state.json` still had to be written.
**Root cause:** Verification was used as a mid-implementation checkpoint. The receipt fingerprint is the whole dirty tree, so any later change-package or review-report write invalidates it. Evidence must be recorded only after the last file that will remain in that tree.
