# Evidence

Store human-readable review reports here. Machine receipts live under `.grok-stack/runtime/receipts/` and are bound to the current repository fingerprint.

`state.json` holds canonical local checkpoints and explicit evidence accounting. A `not_run` reason explains unfinished work; a recorded result is self-reported and does not satisfy a passing receipt. Checkpoints are observations in this worktree, and become available to another clone only when separately committed and published.

New-package and first-implementation observations are appended below by the lifecycle commands. A pending README mirror is surfaced in status and can be retried with the same explicit lifecycle command; state and README publication is not a two-file atomic transaction.

Code and test review reports perform bounded, change-relevant mutation probes in a reviewer-owned private scratch copy outside the reviewed worktree. Keep the reviewed candidate read-only; use scratch below a trusted non-sticky parent with mode `0700`. Reproduce the exact candidate (HEAD and relevant staged, unstaged, and untracked changes), record its HEAD and tree fingerprint before/after, and treat unsafe or mismatched snapshots and changed fingerprints as stale/inconclusive. Reviewer read-only configuration is not an OS-enforced isolation boundary.

Reviewers return the complete report to the coordinator out-of-band and do not write into the candidate worktree. After all reviews finish, the coordinator persists all reports here, then reruns final verification and records fresh fingerprint-bound receipts for the tree containing those reports.

Each report must include:

- source identity: HEAD and candidate tree fingerprint;
- scratch path and `reviewed-tree-modified: no`;
- each claim probed, exact command, concise observed output, and mutant outcome (`killed`, `survived`, or `inconclusive`);
- claims not executed and why; static claims without executable probes are unexecuted;
- surviving mutants as findings or explicit limitations (no blanket mutation-score threshold unless a scoped policy requires it).
